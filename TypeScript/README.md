## TypeScript vs Javascript

* Typescript is, in some sense, a superset of Javascript
* Typescript is essentially a *static checking* method for JS
* There are errors, for example "2 + '2'" which shouldn't be allowed and will cause error when going into NodeJS module, etc.
> Typescript will prevented it happening by checking the error in the IDE
